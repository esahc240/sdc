    "We have a data set consisting of 10,000 rows from customers at a bank. We want to assess and address the problem of client churn. 6 months ago the bank took a small sample of customers and measured everything they knew. We're going to check the column \"exited\" to see if a client left in the 6 month window; 1 = left 0 = stayed. Your goal is to create a _geodemographic segmentation model_ to tell the bank which clients are most likely to leave. \n",
